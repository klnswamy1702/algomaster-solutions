### Backtracking Approach

**Intuition:**

The goal is to distribute cookies to kids such that the maximum cookies any kid gets is minimized. The naïve approach involves trying all possible distributions and keeping track of the minimum "maximum" value of cookies for any configuration. This calls for a backtracking strategy where we recursively assign cookies to kids and backtrack if the current distribution leads to an unsatisfactory result.

**Approach:**

1. We start by initializing the current maximum distribution to infinity.
2. Use a recursive function to iterate over cookies and try assigning each to the current kid, while keeping track of the distribution.
3. If the recursion reaches a point where all cookies have been assigned, update the result with the minimum possible largest share.
4. Backtrack and try different distributions to explore all possible configurations.

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int DistributeCookies(int[] cookies, int k) {
        int[] distribution = new int[k];
        return Backtracking(cookies, distribution, 0, int.MaxValue);
    }
    
    private int Backtracking(int[] cookies, int[] distribution, int idx, int currentMax) {
        // If all cookies have been distributed
        if (idx == cookies.Length) {
            // Calculate the maximum cookies received by any kid
            int maxCookies = distribution.Max();
            return Math.Min(currentMax, maxCookies);
        }
        
        int result = currentMax;
        for (int i = 0; i < distribution.Length; i++) {
            // Assign current cookie to kid i
            distribution[i] += cookies[idx];
            // Recurse with the next cookie
            result = Math.Min(result, Backtracking(cookies, distribution, idx + 1, result));
            // Backtrack - remove the cookie from kid i and try next kid
            distribution[i] -= cookies[idx];
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity:** \(O(k^n)\) - where \(n\) is the number of cookies and \(k\) is the number of children, since we explore \(k\) possibilities for each cookie.

**Space Complexity:** \(O(k)\) - to store cookie distribution.

### Dynamic Programming Approach

**Intuition:**

This approach would involve a bit more complexity, where memoization is used to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations during recursion. 

**Approach:**

1. Define a DP state that considers the number of cookies assigned, the index of the current cookie, and the distribution state.
2. For each state, calculate the best possible "unfairness" by trying all possible assignments and using previously calculated states.
3. Carefully update states considering each cookie's addition to the children so that the space and time complexities remain within reasonable bounds.

**Note:** Although a full detailed DP solution is often more complex and offers improvements on specific edge cases or constraints, for simplicity and current problem constraints handling, the backtracking approach remains highly effective and intuitive.

**Time Complexity and Space Complexity:** very similar attempt applies with dynamic strategies, and advanced state representation is needed for small subproblem optimizations.

Since the focus is on contrastive approaches and the solution space for DP can go highly variable due to state representation and transition complexity, it often involves a custom plan to improve over deterministic layers. Let’s stick to the backtracking solution for approachable understanding.

By exploring these approaches, over time a deeper understanding of problem constraints will suggest when switch to iterative or memoized strategy would bring about significant optimizations.
