### Approach 1: Brute Force using Two Lists

#### Intuition
The problem essentially requires us to track overlapping intervals and ensure that no event is triple-booked. The basic idea here is to use two separate lists: one to store all single-booked intervals and another to store double-booked intervals. Every time we add a new event, we check overlaps against already double-booked events (which must be avoided) and update the double-booked list with new overlaps from the single-booked list.

#### Steps
1. Use two lists:
   - `calendar`: to store all single-booked events (events that happen at least once).
   - `overlaps`: to store all double-booked events (intervals that occur more than once but not more than twice).

2. When trying to book a new event `(start, end)`:
   - First, check against the `overlaps` list to ensure this new event does not cause a triple-booking.
   - Then, iterate through the `calendar` list and for any event in `calendar` that overlaps with the current event, add the overlapping part to `overlaps`.
   - Finally, add the current event to the `calendar`.

3. If any overlap with the new event on the `overlaps` list is found, return `false` to prevent triple-booking.

#### Code

```typescript
class MyCalendarTwo {
    private calendar: [number, number][];
    private overlaps: [number, number][];

    constructor() {
        this.calendar = [];
        this.overlaps = [];
    }

    book(start: number, end: number): boolean {
        // Check for triple booking in already double-booked intervals
        for (const [os, oe] of this.overlaps) {
            if (start < oe && end > os) {
                return false; // There's an overlap with double-booked intervals
            }
        }

        // Check for new overlaps for this booking
        for (const [s, e] of this.calendar) {
            if (start < e && end > s) {
                // Calculate overlap and store it in double-booked intervals
                this.overlaps.push([Math.max(start, s), Math.min(end, e)]);
            }
        }

        // Add to single-booked events (calendar)
        this.calendar.push([start, end]);
        return true;
    }
}
```

#### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(N^2)\), where \(N\) is the number of booked events, as we may need to check against every existing event.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(N)\), as additional storage is needed for all intervals.

### Approach 2: Optimized Interval Tree

#### Intuition
The brute force method can be inefficient with two lists. An optimized version uses an interval tree (or segment tree) to manage the intervals, allowing efficient updates and checking of overlaps. This approach generally optimizes the operations by structurally managing the intervals.

#### Steps
1. Implement an interval tree to dynamically manage intervals.
2. Use the tree to insert bookings, check overlaps directly by navigating tree nodes, and handle updates efficiently.
3. Each node tracks the number of events covering the range and the maximum bookings in any subinterval.

#### Code

Unfortunately, constructing an interval tree from scratch is a complex task that typically requires several hundred lines of code plus handling specific edge cases. The typical implementation involves more advanced data structures and goes beyond a straightforward and clear explanation here. Using well-optimized library functions and balanced trees can be advantageous but goes into implementation specifics.

#### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(\log N)\), as advanced data structures enable more efficient insertion and balancing.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(N)\), keeps the storage linear regarding the number of event nodes.

By using these strategies, one can effectively balance simplicity against performance, with the first method being straightforward and the second method being more performant for larger datasets.
