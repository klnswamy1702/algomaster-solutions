## Approach 1: Brute Force - Using a Set

### Intuition:
The simplest way to determine if a linked list has a cycle is by using a Set (or HashSet/Map). As we iterate through the list, we can store each node we visit in the set. If we encounter a node that is already in the set, then we know there's a cycle, and that node is where the cycle begins.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited nodes.
2. Start from the head of the linked list.
3. For each node, check if it's already in the set:
   - If it is, return that node as it is the start of the cycle.
   - If not, add it to the set.
4. If the loop terminates without finding a cycle, return null (no cycle).

### Code:

```typescript
class ListNode {
    val: number;
    next: ListNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
        this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next);
    }
}

function detectCycle(head: ListNode | null): ListNode | null {
    const visitedNodes: Set<ListNode> = new Set();

    let currentNode = head;

    while (currentNode !== null) {
        // If currentNode is already visited, there is a cycle.
        if (visitedNodes.has(currentNode)) {
            return currentNode;
        }
        // Add currentNode to the visited set
        visitedNodes.add(currentNode);
        // Move to the next node
        currentNode = currentNode.next;
    }

    // If no cycle was detected
    return null;
}
```

### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) - Each node is processed at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) - We store each node in the set.

## Approach 2: Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Algorithm

### Intuition:
This approach uses two pointers: a slow pointer (tortoise) and a fast pointer (hare). The fast pointer moves twice as fast as the slow pointer. If there's a cycle in the list, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer inside the cycle. At that point, to find the cycleâ€™s entry point, we reset one pointer to the start of the list and move both pointers one step at a time; they will meet at the cycle's starting node.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`. Both start at the head of the list.
2. Move `slow` one step and `fast` two steps through the list:
   - If `fast` or `fast.next` becomes null, there's no cycle. Return null.
   - If `slow` equals `fast`, there's a cycle, break the loop.
3. Reset `slow` to the head.
4. Move both `slow` and `fast` one step at a time until they meet:
   - The node where they meet is the starting node of the cycle.

### Code:

```typescript
function detectCycle(head: ListNode | null): ListNode | null {
    if (!head || !head.next) return null;

    let slow: ListNode | null = head;
    let fast: ListNode | null = head;

    // Phase 1: Determine if a cycle exists
    while (fast !== null && fast.next !== null) {
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
        if (slow === fast) {
            // Cycle detected
            break;
        }
    }
    
    // If there is no cycle
    if (fast === null || fast.next === null) {
        return null;
    }

    // Phase 2: Find the start of the cycle
    slow = head;
    while (slow !== fast) {
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next;
    }

    // Both pointers are now at the start of the cycle
    return slow;
}
```

### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) - We only traverse the linked list a few times.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - No additional storage is used.
