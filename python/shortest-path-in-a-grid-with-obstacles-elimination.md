### 1. Breadth-First Search (BFS) with Queue

#### Intuition:
The grid can be navigated in multiple ways but due to obstacles, we must find the shortest path while also considering the possibility of eliminating a certain number of obstacles. This problem is a variation of the classic shortest path problem in a grid, which can be modeled using BFS. BFS is ideal because it explores all possibilities level by level, guaranteeing the shortest path is found. We maintain a state that includes the current position in the grid and the number of obstacles eliminated so far. Using a queue, we perform BFS where each state is processed by visiting all possible next states (i.e., grid cells to the left, right, top, and bottom).

#### Detailed Approach:
- Use a queue to facilitate BFS, and a set to keep track of visited states to avoid reprocessing.
- Each item in the queue contains the current cell's coordinates `(x, y)`, the number of obstacles eliminated so far, and the current path length.
- Only explore a cell if:
    - It is within grid boundaries.
    - It has not been visited with the same or higher available obstacle eliminations.
    - The path through it yields fewer obstacles eliminated than allowed.
- The BFS terminates upon reaching the bottom-right cell with the shortest path length computed.

#### Implementation:

```python
from collections import deque

def shortestPath(grid, k):
    # Get dimensions of the grid
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0]) 
    # Initialize the queue with starting point (0,0)
    queue = deque([(0, 0, 0, 0)])  # (row, col, steps, obstacles eliminated)
    visited = {(0, 0, 0)}           # Visited set to prevent revisiting state
    
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4 possible directions
    
    while queue:
        r, c, steps, obs = queue.popleft()
        
        # If reach bottom-right corner
        if r == rows - 1 and c == cols - 1:
            return steps
        
        # Explore the neighbors
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:  # Check boundaries
                new_obs = obs + grid[nr][nc]        # Calculate new obstacles count
                
                # If not visited, or found better path with fewer obstacles
                if new_obs <= k and (nr, nc, new_obs) not in visited:
                    visited.add((nr, nc, new_obs))     # Mark as visited
                    queue.append((nr, nc, steps + 1, new_obs))  # Add new state to queue
    
    return -1  # No path found

# Test the BFS solution
# Example usage (un-comment to test in a separate Python environment):
# grid = [[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0]]
# k = 1
# print(shortestPath(grid, k))  # Output: 6
```

#### Complexity analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \times m \times k)\) where \(n\) and \(m\) are rows and columns of the grid, respectively. Each state for each cell is visited at most \(k\) times.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n \times m \times k)\) for the visited states storage.

### 2. A* Search Algorithm

#### Intuition:
The A* search algorithm is an informed search algorithm, often used in pathfinding and graph traversals. It uses a heuristic to decide the likely shortest path to the goal. The challenge is to define a suitable heuristic function that efficiently guides the search towards the goal, while leveraging the obstacle elimination feature for optimization.

#### Detailed Approach:
- Use a priority queue (min heap) to store potential paths with priority given by the sum of the path length and a heuristic.
- Heuristic: Set as the Manhattan distance to the bottom-right corner reduced by any remaining obstacle eliminations.
- Choosing states from the priority queue minimizes exploration of less promising paths and prioritizes exploration of paths that potentially lead faster to the goal.

#### Implementation:

```python
import heapq

def shortestPathAStar(grid, k):
    # Basic grid checks
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    
    # Early exit if starting point is the destination
    if rows == 1 and cols == 1: 
        return 0
    
    # Helper function to calculate heuristic
    def heuristic(x, y, eliminations):
        return abs(rows - 1 - x) + abs(cols - 1 - y) - eliminations
    
    # Min-heap for the openlist (priority queue)
    heap = [(0 + heuristic(0, 0, k), 0, 0, 0, k)]  # (f_val, steps, r, c, remaining_k)
    visited = set((0, 0, k))
    
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4 possible movements
    
    while heap:
        _, steps, r, c, remaining_k = heapq.heappop(heap)
        
        # Explore each direction
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:
                new_remaining_k = remaining_k - grid[nr][nc]
                
                if new_remaining_k >= 0 and (nr, nc, new_remaining_k) not in visited:
                    visited.add((nr, nc, new_remaining_k))
                    
                    # If reached destination, return number of steps
                    if nr == rows - 1 and nc == cols - 1:
                        return steps + 1
                    
                    # Calculate f_val (g_val + h_val)
                    g_val = steps + 1
                    f_val = g_val + heuristic(nr, nc, new_remaining_k)
                    
                    # Heuristic guides to better paths first
                    heapq.heappush(heap, (f_val, g_val, nr, nc, new_remaining_k))
    
    return -1  # If no path is found

# Test the A* solution
# Example usage (un-comment to test in a separate Python environment):
# grid = [[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0]]
# k = 1
# print(shortestPathAStar(grid, k))  # Output: 6
```

#### Complexity analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: In the worst case, similarly, it could involve \(O(n \times m \times k)\). However, A* often performs better in practice because it uses heuristics to prioritize promising paths.
- **Space Complexity**: Similar to BFS, \(O(n \times m \times k)\).

Both solutions offer an effective way to solve the problem of obstacle elimination in a grid, utilizing different strategies: BFS focuses on breadth and ensures all possibilities are seen in breadth-first order, while A* prioritizes paths that appear more promising due to the heuristic guiding it.
