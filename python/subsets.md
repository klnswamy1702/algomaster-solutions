[**Leetcode Problem 78: Subsets**](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/)

**Approaches:**
- [Approach 1: Cascading](#approach-1-cascading)
- [Approach 2: Backtracking](#approach-2-backtracking)

## Approach 1: Cascading

### Intuition:
The cascading approach iteratively builds all possible subsets. The idea is to start with an empty subset and keep adding each number one by one to all existing subsets. This method exploits the fact that given a set, you can always create a new subset by adding a new element to each subset of the existing subsets.

### Detailed Code:

```python
def subsets(nums):
    # Start with an empty subset
    result = [[]]
    
    # Process each number in the input list
    for num in nums:
        # For each current subset, create a new subset by adding the current number
        result += [current_subset + [num] for current_subset in result]

    return result
```

### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(N * 2^N)  
  We generate each subset by iterating through the available numbers and expanding the list of subsets.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N * 2^N)  
  The number of elements in the result grows exponentially with the size of the input due to the expanding subsets.

## Approach 2: Backtracking

### Intuition:
Backtracking is a classic algorithmic technique for solving problems incrementally, considering one piece at a time and removing solutions that fail to satisfy the problem constraints. Here, it systematically builds the subsets by choosing or not choosing each element, exploring all possibilities.

### Detailed Code:

```python
def subsets(nums):
    def backtrack(start, current_subset):
        # Add the current subset (which might be at any depth)
        result.append(list(current_subset))
        
        # Explore further elements to be added
        for i in range(start, len(nums)):
            # Include the number nums[i] in the subset
            current_subset.append(nums[i])
            # Move on to the next element with the updated current_subset
            backtrack(i + 1, current_subset)
            # Backtrack: remove the last element and explore other possibilities
            current_subset.pop()

    result = []
    backtrack(0, [])
    return result
```

### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(N * 2^N)  
  We call the recursive function for each subset. In the worst-case scenario, the function generates all subsets (which amounts to 2^N subsets).
- **Space Complexity**: O(N)  
  In terms of additional space used, the maximum depth of recursion is N, and the extra space is primarily due to recursion stack storage.

Both methods effectively explore all subsets, with slight differences in strategy â€” one iteratively, and the other recursively. The choice between them could depend on personal preference, readability, or other constraints.
