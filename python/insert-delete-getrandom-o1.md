### Approach 1: Using Lists and Hash Maps

**Intuition:**

The main challenge in this problem is to achieve the `O(1)` time complexity for insert, delete, and getRandom operations. Using a list to store elements allows us to retrieve a random element efficiently (as `random.choice` gives `O(1)` complexity). However, this approach requires additional logic to maintain the index position during deletions efficiently, for which a hash map can be utilized.

- We'll use a list to hold the actual values.
- A hash map will map values to their indices in the list.
- For insertion, simply append the value to the list and add its index to the hash map.
- For deletion, swap the value to be deleted with the last element in the list to avoid `O(n)` complexity and update the map.
- The getRandom operation will be `O(1)` as it picks a random element directly from the list.

```python
import random

class RandomizedSet:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize an empty list to store elements
        self.list = []
        # Map values to their respective indices in the list
        self.map = {}

    def insert(self, val: int) -> bool:
        # Check if the value is already present
        if val in self.map:
            return False
        # Append the value to the list
        self.list.append(val)
        # Store its index in the map
        self.map[val] = len(self.list) - 1
        return True

    def remove(self, val: int) -> bool:
        # Check if the value is present
        if val not in self.map:
            return False
        # Get index of the element to remove
        idx_to_remove = self.map[val]
        # Move the last element to the place of the element to remove
        last_element = self.list[-1]
        self.list[idx_to_remove] = last_element
        self.map[last_element] = idx_to_remove
        # Remove the last element
        self.list.pop()
        del self.map[val]
        return True

    def getRandom(self) -> int:
        # Choose a random element
        return random.choice(self.list)

# Time Complexity: O(1) for insert, remove, and getRandom
# Space Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the set
```

**Complexity Analysis:**

- **Time Complexity**: `O(1)` for each operation (`insert`, `remove`, `getRandom`).
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of elements stored in the set.

### Approach 2: Constant Time Operations using Hash Map and List

**Intuition:**

The first approach already provides an optimal solution with the use of a list and a hash map. However, we need to ensure that the operations are consistently `O(1)`, and barring edge cases or performance fluctuations due to unexpected factors (e.g., many random calls causing cache inefficiencies), the satisfiable outcome will remain.

Given that the problem specifically mandates `O(1)` operations, no further algorithm can push the complexity boundaries. Therefore, sticking with a robust understanding and handling of python's list and dict data structures is essential. These structures inherently provide `O(1)` for average operations (lookup, insert, delete) due to their underlying hashing and dynamic sizing mechanisms.

Since these data structures are designed to offer thrifty time complexities with the constraints provided, the previous approach remains best suited, and no additional distinct strategies from this point further decrease the complexity.

Thus, retaining the same approach is necessary with more focus on code efficiency and preventive measures for hash collisions if a similar problem arises in non-ideal computing frameworks.
