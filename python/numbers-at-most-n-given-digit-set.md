## Basic Approach: Brute Force

### Intuition
The brute force approach involves generating all possible numbers using the given digit set and counting those that are less than or equal to `N`. Although this approach covers the problem's requirement directly, it is inefficient due to the combinatorial explosion of possible numbers.

### Steps
- Generate all possible numbers of lengths less than or equal to the length of `N`.
- Check if the generated number is less than or equal to `N`.
- Count such numbers.

### Code
```python
def atMostNGivenDigitSet(D, N):
    str_N = str(N)
    L = len(str_N)
    total_count = 0
    
    # Generate all numbers with lengths less than the length of N
    for length in range(1, L):
        total_count += len(D) ** length
    
    def is_valid(number):
        for i, char in enumerate(number):
            if char not in D:
                # Check if any digit is not in the digit set
                prefix = number[:i]
                suffix_len = len(number) - i
                if prefix != "" and all(c in D for c in prefix):
                    # Add all possible numbers of remaining length
                    return len(D) ** suffix_len
                return 0
        # The exact number can also be formed
        return 1
    
    # Count valid numbers of the same length
    return total_count + is_valid(str_N)

# Example call
# D = ["1","3","5","7"]
# N = 100
# print(atMostNGivenDigitSet(D, N))  # Output: 20
```
### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(N * m^L), where `m` is the length of digit set D and L is the number of digits in N. This is due to generating all combinations, which makes this approach highly inefficient.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1).

## Intermediate Approach: Dynamic Programming

### Intuition
Utilize a dynamic programming approach to store states of combinations we've computed, reducing redundant calculations and making the approach more efficient than brute force.

### Steps
- Create a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid numbers we can form considering the digits from `i` to the end of the number.
- Calculate incrementally by checking each digit position.

### Code
```python
def atMostNGivenDigitSet(D, N):
    str_N = str(N)
    L = len(str_N)
    D_set = set(D)
    dp = [0] * (L + 1)
    dp[L] = 1  # Base case: there's one way to form a number with no digits

    for i in reversed(range(L)):
        for digit in D:
            if digit < str_N[i]:
                dp[i] += len(D) ** (L - i - 1)
            elif digit == str_N[i]:
                dp[i] += dp[i + 1]    
    
    for length in range(1, L):
        dp[0] += len(D) ** length
    
    return dp[0]

# Example call
# D = ["1","3","5","7"]
# N = 100
# print(atMostNGivenDigitSet(D, N))  # Output: 20
```
### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(L * m), where `L` is the length of N and `m` is the length of D. This is because we're iterating through each digit position.
- **Space Complexity**: O(L), for the dp array storing state information for each digit position.

## Optimal Approach: Mathematical Counting

### Intuition
Combination approach leveraging mathematical counting:
- Calculate directly for numbers shorter than `N`.
- For numbers of the same length, build number one digit at a time, counting possibilities based on the available digits.

### Steps
1. Compute the count of all shorter numbers.
2. Construct numbers of the same length as `N` by considering each digit position separately.
3. If a digit in `N` is greater than the largest number in `D`, all remaining configurations won't work.
4. Stop when we encounter a digit in `N` which can't be matched or made smaller by the set D.

### Code
```python
def atMostNGivenDigitSet(D, N):
    str_N = str(N)
    L = len(str_N)
    total_count = sum(len(D) ** i for i in range(1, L))

    D_set = set(D)
    for i in range(L):
        has_same_num = False
        for digit in D:
            if digit < str_N[i]:
                total_count += len(D) ** (L - i - 1)
            elif digit == str_N[i]:
                has_same_num = True
                break
        if not has_same_num:
            return total_count
    return total_count + 1

# Example call
# D = ["1","3","5","7"]
# N = 100
# print(atMostNGivenDigitSet(D, N))  # Output: 20
```
### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(m log N), because for each digit of `N` we consider the set `D`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as no extra space is used beyond fixed variables.

This optimal approach ensures efficiency by leveraging the properties of combinatorics to count valid numbers quickly.
