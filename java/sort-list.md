### Approach 1: Merge Sort (Top-Down)

**Intuition:**

Merge Sort is an efficient and systematic way of sorting linked lists because it divides the list into halves, sorts, and then merges them back. In a linked list, accessing middle elements directly isn't as straightforward as arrays. However, we can find the middle using the "fast and slow pointer" strategy.

- **Divide**: Use the fast-slow pointer method to divide the list into two halves.
- **Conquer**: Recursively sort the sublists.
- **Combine**: Merge the two sorted halves.

**Code:**

```java
public class SortListSolution {
    public ListNode sortList(ListNode head) {
        // Base case: If the list is empty or has a single node, it is already sorted
        if (head == null || head.next == null) {
            return head;
        }

        // Step 1: Split the list into halves using slow and fast pointers
        ListNode slow = head, fast = head, prev = null;
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            prev = slow;
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }
        // Disconnect the first half from the second half
        prev.next = null;

        // Step 2: Sort each half
        ListNode leftHalf = sortList(head);
        ListNode rightHalf = sortList(slow);

        // Step 3: Merge the sorted halves
        return merge(leftHalf, rightHalf);
    }

    // Function to merge two sorted linked lists
    private ListNode merge(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode current = dummy;
        while (l1 != null && l2 != null) {
            if (l1.val < l2.val) {
                current.next = l1;
                l1 = l1.next;
            } else {
                current.next = l2;
                l2 = l2.next;
            }
            current = current.next;
        }
        // At the end of while, one of the lists could have remaining nodes
        current.next = l1 != null ? l1 : l2;
        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. Each split divides the list into two halves, and merging takes linear time.

**Space Complexity:** O(log n) due to the recursive stack space.

### Approach 2: Merge Sort (Bottom-Up)

**Intuition:**

The bottom-up merge sort iteratively merges sublists of increasing size. This approach doesn't use recursion, thus avoids the overhead of recursive function calls â€” potentially saving stack space and making it iterative.

- **Iteratively** combine sublists of size 1, 2, 4, and so forth.
- Start from small chunks, keep combining until the entire list is sorted.

**Code:**

```java
public class SortListSolution {
    public ListNode sortList(ListNode head) {
        // Base case: If the list is empty or has a single node, it is already sorted
        if (head == null || head.next == null) {
            return head;
        }

        // Step to determine the length of the list
        ListNode current = head;
        int length = 0;
        while (current != null) {
            length++;
            current = current.next; 
        }

        // Dummy node setup
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy.next = head;
        
        // Bottom-up merge sort
        for (int step = 1; step < length; step *= 2) {
            ListNode prev = dummy;
            ListNode curr = dummy.next;
            while (curr != null) {
                ListNode left = curr;
                ListNode right = split(left, step);
                curr = split(right, step);
                prev = merge(left, right, prev);
            }
        }
        return dummy.next;
    }

    // Split the list at step size and return the head of the second list
    private ListNode split(ListNode head, int step) {
        for (int i = 1; head != null && i < step; i++) {
            head = head.next;
        }
        if (head == null) return null;
        ListNode second = head.next;
        head.next = null;
        return second;
    }

    // Merging two lists and appending to prev, returning the last node after merge
    private ListNode merge(ListNode l1, ListNode l2, ListNode prev) {
        ListNode current = prev;

        while (l1 != null && l2 != null) {
            if (l1.val < l2.val) {
                current.next = l1;
                l1 = l1.next;
            } else {
                current.next = l2;
                l2 = l2.next;
            }
            current = current.next;
        }
        current.next = l1 != null ? l1 : l2;

        // Move current to the end of the new merged list
        while (current.next != null) {
            current = current.next;
        }
        return current;
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n), similar to the top-down approach. Each pass through the list doubling the size effectively achieves the merge.

**Space Complexity:** O(1), this is an in-place sorting algorithm with no additional space use aside from a few pointers.
