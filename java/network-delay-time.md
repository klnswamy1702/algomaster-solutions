### Approach 1: Dijkstra's Algorithm using Priority Queue (Min-Heap)

#### Intuition
Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm is a classic approach to find the shortest paths from a single source node to all other nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights. By using a priority queue, we can efficiently choose the next node to process based on the smallest known distance.

#### Steps

1. **Graph Representation**: We first represent the graph using an adjacency list where each node points to its neighbors along with the time taken to reach them.
  
2. **Priority Queue (Min-Heap)**: Initialize a min-heap that will store elements as pairs of (time, node). The heap will prioritize nodes with smaller times.

3. **Distance Table**: Create a distance table initialized with infinity (`Integer.MAX_VALUE`) values to represent the shortest time (distance) from source `K` to each node. Set the distance to the source node `K` as 0.

4. **Processing Nodes**: 
   - While the priority queue is not empty, remove the node with the smallest time.
   - For each neighbor of the current node, calculate the new time to reach that neighbor.
   - If this new time is smaller than the previously recorded time in the distance table, update the table and add the neighbor to the priority queue.
  
5. **Finding the Result**: The result is the maximum value from the distance table. If there's any node that remains at infinity, it means it's unreachable from the source `K`.

#### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int networkDelayTime(int[][] times, int N, int K) {
        Map<Integer, List<int[]>> graph = new HashMap<>();
        for (int[] time : times) {
            graph.computeIfAbsent(time[0], k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(new int[]{time[1], time[2]});
        }

        // Priority queue: (time, node)
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[0]));
        pq.add(new int[]{0, K});
        
        // Distance table
        Map<Integer, Integer> dist = new HashMap<>();
        dist.put(K, 0);
        
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            int[] current = pq.poll();
            int currentTime = current[0];
            int currentNode = current[1];
            
            if (!graph.containsKey(currentNode)) {
                continue;
            }
            
            // Process neighbors
            for (int[] neighbor : graph.get(currentNode)) {
                int nextNode = neighbor[0];
                int timeToNext = neighbor[1];
                int newTime = currentTime + timeToNext;
                
                if (newTime < dist.getOrDefault(nextNode, Integer.MAX_VALUE)) {
                    dist.put(nextNode, newTime);
                    pq.add(new int[]{newTime, nextNode});
                }
            }
        }
        
        int maxDelay = 0;
        for (int delay : dist.values()) {
            maxDelay = Math.max(maxDelay, delay);
        }
        
        return dist.size() == N ? maxDelay : -1; // If not all nodes are reachable, return -1
    }
}
```

#### Time Complexity
- The time complexity is `O(E log V)`, where `E` is the number of edges and `V` is the number of vertices, due to the heap operations.

#### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is `O(V + E)`, for storing the graph and the distance table.

### Approach 2: Bellman-Ford Algorithm

#### Intuition
The Bellman-Ford algorithm is another method to compute the shortest paths from a single source node to all other nodes in a graph, and it can handle negative weights. It repetitively relaxes all edges, updating the shortest paths.

#### Steps

1. **Initialize Distance Array**: Create a distance array with all nodes initially set to infinity (`Integer.MAX_VALUE`), except for the source node `K` which is set to 0.

2. **Relax Edges N-1 Times**: 
   - For each edge from `u` to `v` with weight `w`, if the current distance to `u` plus `w` is less than the distance to `v`, update the distance to `v`.

3. **Checking for Negative Cycles**: (Not required for this problem since edge weights are non-negative)
   - Run the relaxation step once more to check for improvements, which indicate negative cycles. For this problem, it can be skipped as all weights are positive.

4. **Determine the Result**: Find the maximum time in the distance array. If all nodes are reachable, return this maximum time; otherwise, return `-1`.

#### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int networkDelayTime(int[][] times, int N, int K) {
        int[] dist = new int[N + 1];
        Arrays.fill(dist, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        dist[K] = 0;
        
        // Relax edges N-1 times
        for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; ++i) {
            for (int[] edge : times) {
                int u = edge[0];
                int v = edge[1];
                int w = edge[2];
                if (dist[u] != Integer.MAX_VALUE && dist[u] + w < dist[v]) {
                    dist[v] = dist[u] + w;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Find the maximum time to reach any node
        int maxDelay = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
            maxDelay = Math.max(maxDelay, dist[i]);
        }
        
        return maxDelay == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : maxDelay;
    }
}
```

#### Time Complexity
- The time complexity is `O(V * E)`, as each of the `V` vertices requires `E` edge relaxations.

#### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is `O(V)`, as we only maintain a simple distance array.
