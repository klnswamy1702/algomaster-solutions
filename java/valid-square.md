## Approach 1: Brute Force

### Intuition
The problem of detecting whether four points can form a square boils down to ensuring that there are two unique distances: the side of the square and the diagonal (which is the hypotenuse of the two sides of a right angle triangle formed by two consecutive sides).

For four points to form a square:
- The shortest distances (there should be 4 of them) are the sides of the square.
- The longest distances (there should be 2 of them) are the diagonals.

To solve this brute force, we calculate the distance between each pair of given points and then check the distribution of these distances.

### Implementation

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class Solution {
    public boolean validSquare(int[] p1, int[] p2, int[] p3, int[] p4) {
        // Use a set to store the unique squared distances.
        Set<Integer> distances = new HashSet<>();
        
        // Calculate the squared distances between all pairs of points.
        distances.add(distanceSquared(p1, p2));
        distances.add(distanceSquared(p1, p3));
        distances.add(distanceSquared(p1, p4));
        distances.add(distanceSquared(p2, p3));
        distances.add(distanceSquared(p2, p4));
        distances.add(distanceSquared(p3, p4));
        
        // For a valid square, there should be exactly 2 distinct distances:
        // - The side (occurs 4 times)
        // - The diagonal (occurs 2 times)
        return distances.size() == 2 && !distances.contains(0);
    }

    private int distanceSquared(int[] p1, int[] p2) {
        // Calculate the squared Euclidean distance.
        return (p1[0] - p2[0]) * (p1[0] - p2[0]) + (p1[1] - p2[1]) * (p1[1] - p2[1]);
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(1). Simple calculations with a constant amount of data (fixed number of operations for distance calculation).
- **Space Complexity:** O(1). A constant number of data structures used.

## Approach 2: Sorting and Comparison

### Intuition
We can simplify the check by sorting the points and then analyzing the ordered sequence of distances. The key observation is:
- If you sort points based on their x-coordinate (and secondarily upon y-coordinate if x's are equal), a squareâ€™s points will have inherent order allowing easy direct pairwise comparison.

We can calculate squared distances from a fixed reference, then check fixed positions' conditions of distances.

### Implementation

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Comparator;

public class Solution {
    public boolean validSquare(int[] p1, int[] p2, int[] p3, int[] p4) {
        // Create an array of the points for easy sorting by their coordinates.
        int[][] points = {p1, p2, p3, p4};
        
        // Sort points by x-coordinate, and by y if the x's are the same.
        Arrays.sort(points, new Comparator<int[]>() {
            public int compare(int[] a, int[] b) {
                if (a[0] != b[0]) {
                    return a[0] - b[0];
                }
                return a[1] - b[1];
            }
        });
        
        // After sorting, check the properties of the square by calculating distances.
        return distanceSquared(points[0], points[1]) == distanceSquared(points[1], points[3]) &&
               distanceSquared(points[1], points[3]) == distanceSquared(points[3], points[2]) &&
               distanceSquared(points[0], points[2]) == distanceSquared(points[1], points[3]) &&
               distanceSquared(points[0], points[3]) == distanceSquared(points[1], points[2]) &&
               distanceSquared(points[0], points[1]) > 0;
    }

    private int distanceSquared(int[] p1, int[] p2) {
        return (p1[0] - p2[0]) * (p1[0] - p2[0]) + (p1[1] - p2[1]) * (p1[1] - p2[1]);
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(1), primarily due to the fixed nature of point sorting and distance parsing, despite operationally implementing a constant array flow. 
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since limited data-consuming structures are wielded.
