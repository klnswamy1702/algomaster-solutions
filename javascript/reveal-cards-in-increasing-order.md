### Naive Simulation Approach

#### Intuition
To simulate the process described in the problem, we simply keep track of the current deck's state at each step according to the 'reveal' order. This involves sorting the cards and then using an iterative approach to mimic the steps of revealing and placing cards back under the deck.

#### Detailed Steps
1. Sort the deck of cards since we need to reveal them in increasing order.
2. Use a list to simulate the revealing process.
3. Simulate the process of taking the top card, placing a card back, and revealing the next card.

#### JavaScript Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} deck
 * @return {number[]}
 */
function deckRevealedIncreasing(deck) {
    // Step 1: Sort the deck in ascending order
    deck.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    // Step 2: Initialize an array to simulate the revealing process
    let revealed = new Array(deck.length);
    let indices = Array.from({ length: deck.length }, (_, i) => i);
    
    // Step 3: Simulate revealing cards in increasing order
    for (let card of deck) {
        // Place the current smallest card to the first available position
        revealed[indices.shift()] = card;
        // If there is any card left, move the next position to the end
        if (indices.length) {
            indices.push(indices.shift());
        }
    }
    
    return revealed;
}
```

#### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n log n)` due to sorting the deck initially and then `O(n)` for simulating the process.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` due to additional space used by the indices array.

### Efficient Queue Simulation

#### Intuition
By leveraging a queue structure, we can efficiently manage the sequence of operations required to simulate the deck revealing process. This approach can efficiently manipulate the order of card indexes through known operations.

#### Detailed Steps
1. Start by sorting the deck.
2. Use a queue to keep track of indices where cards can be placed.
3. As we place cards in sorted order, alternate between placing a card and enqueuing an index for future use.

#### JavaScript Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} deck
 * @return {number[]}
 */
function deckRevealedIncreasing(deck) {
    // Step 1: Sort the deck in ascending order
    deck.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    // Step 2: Initialize a queue to manage indices
    let queue = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < deck.length; i++) {
        queue.push(i);
    }
    
    // Step 3: Prepare an array to hold the sorted card revealing
    let result = new Array(deck.length);
    
    // Step 4: Allocate each card in sorted order to the appropriate index
    for (let card of deck) {
        // Place the card at the first available position
        result[queue.shift()] = card;
        // Move the next index to the end of the queue
        if (queue.length) {
            queue.push(queue.shift());
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

#### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n log n)` due to sorting. Queue operations are `O(n)`.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` for the result and queue arrays.

Each of these approaches provides an intuitive path to solving the problem, with the second approach offering efficient management of the card placement with the use of a queue.
