### 1. Recursive Backtracking with Memoization

**Intuition:**

This problem is a classical example of partitioning tasks into sessions, which is closely related to the bin packing problem. The goal here is to minimize the number of "bins" (work sessions), while efficiently packing them with tasks so that their length does not exceed the session limit.

The recursive approach with memoization involves recursively attempting to allocate tasks into available sessions and storing the results in a memoization table to avoid redundant calculations.

**Implementation:**

```go
func minSessions(tasks []int, sessionTime int) int {
    n := len(tasks)
    memo := make(map[int]int)

    var dfs func(int, int) int
    dfs = func(mask, remainingTime int) int {
        if mask == 0 {
            return 0
        }
        if _, ok := memo[mask]; ok {
            return memo[mask]
        }
        
        minSessions := n
        for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
            if mask&(1<<i) != 0 {
                if tasks[i] <= remainingTime {
                    minSessions = min(minSessions, dfs(mask^(1<<i), remainingTime-tasks[i]))
                } else {
                    minSessions = min(minSessions, 1+dfs(mask^(1<<i), sessionTime-tasks[i]))
                }
            }
        }
        memo[mask] = minSessions
        return minSessions
    }
    
    return dfs((1<<n)-1, sessionTime) + 1
}

func min(a, b int) int {
    if a < b {
        return a
    }
    return b
}
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n * 2^n) because there are at most 2^n different task subsets and for each subset, we iterate through at most n tasks.

**Space Complexity:** O(n * 2^n) for the memoization table.

### 2. Iterative Bitmask DP

**Intuition:**

Using a bitmask dynamic programming approach, we can efficiently track the subsets of tasks that can be completed within the session time limit. The idea is to simulate all possible sessions using a binary representation of tasks assignments, minimizing sessions as we compute.

**Implementation:**

```go
func minSessions(tasks []int, sessionTime int) int {
    n := len(tasks)
    // All subsets are initially set to session count of n+1 (impossible high value)
    dp := make([]int, 1<<n)
    for i := range dp {
        dp[i] = n + 1
    }
    dp[0] = 0
    
    for mask := 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++ {
        currentTime := 0
        for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
            if mask&(1<<i) != 0 {
                currentTime += tasks[i]
            }
        }
        for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
            if mask&(1<<i) == 0 {
                newMask := mask | (1 << i)
                if currentTime+tasks[i] <= sessionTime {
                    dp[newMask] = min(dp[newMask], dp[mask])
                } else {
                    dp[newMask] = min(dp[newMask], dp[mask]+1)
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[(1<<n)-1]
}
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n^2 * 2^n) due to potential examination of each task subset (2^n) with n tasks per state.

**Space Complexity:** O(2^n) space required to store session counts for each subset of tasks.

By using these approaches, you can tackle the task allocation problem in a manner that explores different combinations of task assignments efficiently.
